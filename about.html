        <h1>About me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a Vietnamese student who's wandering around the Internet.</li>
            <li>My mother tongue is Vietnamese, but I can also use English.</li>
            <li>I am an otaku (?). I love anime, manga and Japanese culture in general.</li>
            <li>I play lots of different video games. I have played video games since first time I used a computer (3yo). The first video game I played was Counter Strike, it's still one of my favorite games.</li>
            <li>I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly (lofi) hip-hop and (indie/pop/alt) rock. I also listen to some J-Pop and Japanese Vocaloid. You can check out my listens on last.fm</li>
            <li>I have been using (GNU/)Linux as my main operating system since 2018, from that I learned more about Internet privacy, free and open-source software and so on.</li>
            <li>My transition to Linux also changed my perspective on many things. I'm more concerned about digital privacy, and I also have been to digital minimalism. Someone once told me I was an ape for not using social media.</li>
